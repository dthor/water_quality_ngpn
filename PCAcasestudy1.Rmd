## Read-in data ##
##################

# This case study runs a PCA on one data matrix in the .xlsx file '3_CaseStudyA.xlsx'
# The matrix represents a year of seasonal data from three sites on the Niobrara River: AGFO, NIOB, and MNRR (see article for descriptions)
# Use the code below to read-in data that is actively copied in your excel spreadsheet (this works for .xls or .csv files)
# Copy your data in the spreadsheet, and while the marquee is still moving, run the code below
# Note that 'header=T' allows the function to recognize header names, and 'row.names=1' allows the function
# to recognize that the first column is the name for each data row

# Select and copy the data matrix (A6:E34) and run this code (press F5 or control-R) while the copy marquee is active:

wq = read.table(file = "clipboard", sep = "\t", header=T, row.names=1)

# Quickly review the content and dimensions of imported data for accuracy

head(wq); dim(wq)

## PCA based on the CORRELATION matrix, instead of the VARIANCE-COVARIANCE matrix: 'cor=T' 
## Since the core parameters are measured on different scales, this ensures the data are normalized to 0 mean, 1 SD
## In the .xlsx file for Case Study A, the site column is labled 'PARKMMM'
## where PARK = 4-letter site code and MMM = abbreviated month
## For these datasets, 15-minute continuous measurements were averaged by month.

# Summary information for PCA

summary(pca)                     # How important is each principal component? (the cumulative proportion is most important here)
print(loadings(pca), cutoff=0)   # Loadings tell you how influential each variable was in forming the ordination spread of points
print(loadings(pca), cutoff=0.4) # Only show loadings 0.4 or greater
plot(pca)                        # This is known as a "scree plot"; it is the visual representation of the variance accounted for in each PC 

# Create a table comparing observed eigenvalues to expected eignevalues (same approach as broken stick spreadsheet file, "2_BrokenStick.xlsx")

obs.eig = pca$sdev^2             # Observed eigenvalues
exp.eig = rev(cumsum(1/(4:1)))   # The expected eignvalues calculated here assume 4 components; 
                                 # For other applications, replace 4 with appropriate number or use (for example): length(pca.results$sdev)
cbind(obs.eig,exp.eig)           # Table output     

# Create biplot
             
biplot(pca)                      # This is the default ordination of PCA scores 

# Slightly cleaned up version of default biplot (informative axis labels, and smaller font for each point)
# To add a title, insert text between "" after 'main='

biplot(pca, main="", xlab="PC1 (SC-pH-DO gradient)", ylab="PC2 (Temp gradient)", cex=0.7)
